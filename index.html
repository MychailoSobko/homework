            <h2>Bass vs guitar</h2>
            
            <p>All we know that jokes about bass being easier to play than a guitar. This page exists to prove that a lot of peolpe are wrong.</p>
            
            <h3>The technique</h3>
            
            <p>Playing bass is actually much different from playing the guitar. Not just because of the four strings, but because of longer neck and higher tension of the strings. Also, many bass players prefer playing with their fitngers over playing vith a pick, even in fast genres of music. And because of the neck's lenght it's harder to work with your left hand, making you suffer in endless pain (jokes on you, people with small hands!).</p>
            
            <h3>Being a valuable asset of the sound</h3>
            
            <p>Maybe you arguments like "But you can't even hear a bass player!". I want to tell you that this statement is, obviously, wrong, because bass guitar takes almost a half(!) of sound frequency, making your ears not bleeding from the raw sound. If you listen to music with bad earphones doesn't mean you can't actually hear the bass guitar. Secondly, bass is a component of the rhytm of a band (siding with the drums) helping you feel the rhytm (obviously).</p>
